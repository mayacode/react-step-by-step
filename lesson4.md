# Lesson 4 - components

Components in react are parts of HTML which have specific responsibility.
It could be a header of a page, a select, data in a table or chart.

The name convection requires naming components from big letter, so there
will be Header, Select, Table or Chart. Camel case is another standard so
SaleChart or UserTable are the proper names.

Component can be created by class or function. Class components since
November 2018 are no more required. Local state or other data which should
persist between function called can be implement using
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html).

Arrow functions look simpler but aren't the best choice for components.
