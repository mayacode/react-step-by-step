# Lesson 3

## Running project with webpack-dev-server

Having project dependencies already installed gives an opportunity
to run simplest possible code example like `Hello World`

For this easiest way is to use `webpack-dev-server` library which together
with `webpack` and `babel` offers transpiling, building and serving. For
development process it is all we need.

Please check [webpack.dev.config.js](client/webpack.dev.config.js) for
build and server configuration.

Please check also changes in [package.json](https://github.com/mayacode/react-step-by-step/commit/4578f948fa512a4ced08f7fee50e1227e8d0ce12#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2)
